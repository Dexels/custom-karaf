 including; features:status to indicate feature loaded or not, feature:chooseurl to make
 it easy to install well known feature files, and a watch command to allow users to watch
 the output of a karaf command like when using the unix watch mechanism. Several dependencies
 were also updated, bringing Spring to 3.0.7-RELEASE, eventadmin to 1.2.14, Apache Pom
 to version 10, the maven bundle plugin to 2.3.7, and fileinstall to 3.2.0.

                    ==================

  Overview
  --------

   New to this release of Apache Karaf is a JAAS Database Login Module, a way to store
 passwords in a secured way, a mechanism that allows a karaf application to distinguish 
 between UserPrincipal and RolePrincipal without depending from the Karaf JAAS Module. 
   The shell console has been enhanced to be available in a plain non-OSGi environment and
 smart tab completion has been improved, along with various commands. 
   We have also resolved a number of outstanding issues, and improved support on OS X and 
 IBM Java based systems. For more detail please see the change log below.
